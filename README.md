#LDAP module for PyroCMS  
AppStucco's LDAP module supports the latest release of PyroCMS 2.x so that your 
enterprise can provide seamless single sign-on functionality for your PyroCMS 
sites. Now your organization can leverage the power of PyroCMS without 
worrying about creating multiple user accounts, and utilize
existing user directories and authentication with LDAP and ActiveDirectory.

##Install  
The LDAP module is actually a package of code that contains  

1. a new admin [PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com) module 
2. a library class
3. a core update to the PyroCMS User module \([ion_auth](http://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)\)  

To install the code follow the installation instructions in the [INSTALL.md](http://github.com/appstucco/LDAP-for-PyroCMS/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file.
